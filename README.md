# Google Foo Bar Challenge!
Here I share some of my code for the Foo Bar Challenge.
I strongly suggest that you spend some time (at least few hours, preferably a few days) thinking up and implementing some solutions first before referring to the solutions of others.
Note that I don't have my solutions for all the questions, as I had just completed challenge 4-2 when I set up this repository.
